several applets:

  + the MATE panel is the area on your desktop from which you can run

    which may be embedded in the panel. These are called applets.
    Documentation for the API is available with gtk-doc.

    List, the Window Selector, the Notification Area, the Clock and the
    infamous 'Wanda the Fish'.
